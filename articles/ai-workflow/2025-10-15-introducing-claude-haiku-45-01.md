Claude Haiku 4.5, our latest small model, is available today to all users.

What was recently at the frontier is now cheaper and faster. Five months ago, Claude Sonnet 4 was a state-of-the-art model. Today, Claude Haiku 4.5 gives you similar levels of coding performance but at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed.

Claude Haiku 4.5 even surpasses Claude Sonnet 4 at certain tasks, like using computers. These advances make applications like [Claude for Chrome](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.37028471-081c-4375-afd0-3ffc7cb98735/chrome) faster and more useful than ever before.

Users who rely on AI for real-time, low-latency tasks like chat assistants, customer service agents, or pair programming will appreciate Haiku 4.5’s combination of high intelligence and remarkable speed. And users of Claude Code will find that Haiku 4.5 makes the coding experience—from multiple-agent projects to rapid prototyping—markedly more responsive.

Claude Sonnet 4.5, released [two weeks ago](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5), remains our frontier model and the best coding model in the world. Claude Haiku 4.5 gives users a new option for when they want near-frontier performance with much greater cost-efficiency. It also opens up new ways of using our models together. For example, Sonnet 4.5 can break down a complex problem into multi-step plans, then orchestrate a team of multiple Haiku 4.5s to complete subtasks in parallel.

Claude Haiku 4.5 is available everywhere today. If you’re a developer, simply use claude-haiku-4-5 via the Claude API. Pricing is now $1/$5 per million input and output tokens.

## Benchmarks

Claude Haiku 4.5 is one of our most powerful models to date. See footnotes for methodology.

> Claude Haiku 4.5 hit a sweet spot we didn't think was possible: **near-frontier coding quality with blazing speed and cost efficiency**. In Augment's agentic coding evaluation, it achieves 90% of Sonnet 4.5's performance, matching much larger models. We're excited to offer it to our users.

> **Claude Haiku 4.5 is a leap forward for agentic coding**, particularly for sub-agent orchestration and computer use tasks. The responsiveness makes AI-assisted development in Warp feel instantaneous.

> Historically models have sacrificed speed and cost for quality. Claude Haiku 4.5 is blurring the lines on this trade off: **it's a fast frontier model that keeps costs efficient** and signals where this class of models is headed.

> **Claude Haiku 4.5 delivers intelligence without sacrificing speed**, enabling us to build AI applications that utilize both deep reasoning and real-time responsiveness.

> Claude Haiku 4.5 is remarkably capable—**just six months ago, this level of performance would have been state-of-the-art** on our internal benchmarks. Now it runs up to 4-5 times faster than Sonnet 4.5 at a fraction of the cost, unlocking an entirely new set of use cases.

> Speed is the new frontier for AI agents operating in feedback loops. **Haiku 4.5 proves you can have both intelligence and rapid output**. It handles complex workflows reliably, self-corrects in real-time, and maintains momentum without latency overhead. For most development tasks, it's the ideal performance balance.

> Claude Haiku 4.5 **outperformed our current models on instruction-following for slide text generation**, achieving 65% accuracy versus 44% from our premium tier model—that's a game-changer for our unit economics.

> Our early testing shows that Claude Haiku 4.5 brings efficient code generation to GitHub Copilot **with comparable quality to Sonnet 4 but at faster speed**. Already we're seeing it as an excellent choice for Copilot users who value speed and responsiveness in their AI-powered development workflows.

## Safety evaluations

We ran a detailed series of safety and alignment evaluations on Claude Haiku 4.5. The model showed low rates of concerning behaviors, and was substantially more aligned than its predecessor, Claude Haiku 3.5. In our automated alignment assessment, Claude Haiku 4.5 also showed a statistically significantly lower overall rate of misaligned behaviors than both Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.1—making Claude Haiku 4.5, by this metric, our safest model yet.

Our safety testing also showed that Claude Haiku 4.5 poses only limited risks in terms of the production of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. For that reason, we’ve released it under the AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) standard—compared to the more restrictive ASL-3 for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1. You can read the full reasoning behind the model’s ASL-2 classification, as well as details on all our other safety tests, in the [Claude Haiku 4.5 system card](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-haiku-4-5-system-card).

## Further information

Claude Haiku 4.5 is available now on Claude Code and our apps. Its efficiency means you can accomplish more within your usage limits while maintaining premium model performance.

Developers can use Claude Haiku 4.5 on our API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, where it serves as a drop-in replacement for both Haiku 3.5 and Sonnet 4 at our most economical price point.
